# Accessible Guitar Tuner 🎸

An accessible, browser-based guitar tuner designed with blind and visually impaired users in mind. Built with the Web Audio API for accurate pitch detection and comprehensive screen reader support.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- **Accurate Pitch Detection** - Uses correlation-based algorithm for precise frequency analysis
- **Real-time Note Identification** - Automatically detects and announces notes as you play
- **Confidence Meter** - Shows detection reliability to help you tune more accurately
- **Reference Tones** - All six guitar string tones (E-A-D-G-B-E) for comparison tuning
- **Vibration Feedback** - Device vibrates when notes are perfectly in tune (inspired by [Anthony S. Ferraro's accessible guitar pedal concept](https://youtube.com/shorts/Bf3_jVREd20))

### ♿ Accessibility Features (Optimized for Blind Users)
- **Screen Reader Announcements** - Automatic audio announcements of detected notes and frequencies
- **ARIA Live Regions** - Dynamic updates properly announced to assistive technologies

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Algorithm
- Uses correlation-based pitch detection for accurate frequency analysis
- Tests 90 frequencies across 30 notes (C2 to C5) with sharp/flat variations
- Confidence threshold prevents false positives
- Complex number calculations for precise phase correlation

### Technologies
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or dependencies required
- **Web Audio API** - Browser-native audio processing
- **Web Workers** - Offloads computation to prevent UI blocking
- **Pico.css** - Lightweight CSS framework for accessibility
- **Vitest** - Comprehensive test suite (44 tests, 100% passing)

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Allow Microphone Access** - Grant permission when prompted
2. **Play a Note** - Strum a string on your guitar or other instrument
3. **Listen for Announcement** - The tuner will announce the detected note and frequency
4. **Feel the Vibration** - When your note is perfectly in tune, your device will vibrate (on supported devices)
5. **Tune Your Instrument** - Adjust until you get the correct note and feel the confirmation vibration
6. **Reference Tones** (Optional) - Use the reference tone buttons to hear any of the six guitar strings for comparison

### For Screen Reader Users
- Enable your screen reader before opening the tuner
- Make sure note announcements are enabled in your screen reader settings
- The tuner will automatically announce each detected note
- Status updates will inform you of initialization, listening state, and any errors

## 🧪 Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:ui         # Interactive test interface
npm run test:coverage   # Coverage report
```

### Local Development
Simply open `index.html` in a web browser, or use any static file server:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve

# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

### Test Coverage
- **Correlation Algorithm Tests** - Validates pitch detection accuracy
- **Main Logic Tests** - Tests frequency generation and confidence calculation
- **Accessibility Tests** - Ensures screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Requires microphone access and Web Audio API support

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Sensitivity
Modify the `confidence_threshold` in `index.html` (currently set to 10):
- Lower values = more sensitive (may detect false positives)
- Higher values = less sensitive (may miss weak signals)

### Customize Reference Tones
The guitar strings array in the JavaScript code defines the six standard tuning frequencies. You can modify `guitar_strings` in `index.html` to use alternate tunings.

### Adjust Test Frequencies
Edit the frequency generation loop to change the note range or add more variations

## 📝 Architecture

- **`index.html`** - Main application with embedded JavaScript and CSS
- **`correlation_worker.js`** - Web Worker for pitch detection calculations
- **`tests/`** - Comprehensive test suite for all functionality

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Based on the original guitar tuner by [Jonathan Bergknoff](http://jonathan.bergknoff.com/journal/making-a-guitar-tuner-html5)
- Enhanced with comprehensive accessibility features
- Styled with [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/)
- **Vibration feedback feature inspired by [Anthony S. Ferraro's accessible guitar pedal concept](https://youtube.com/shorts/Bf3_jVREd20)** - His vision of a guitar pedal that vibrates when each string is in tune for blind musicians directly inspired the vibration confirmation feature in this tuner
